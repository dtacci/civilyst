## üí∞ Cost Management

**Current Monthly Costs: $20-30**

- Vercel: Free tier
- Railway: $5
- Supabase: Free tier
- Clerk: Free (10K MAU)
- Uploadthing: Free (2GB)
- Upstash Redis: Free tier
- Other services: Free tiers

**Scaling Thresholds:**

- $75-100/month: Early growth phase
- $200+/month: Scaling phase with revenue optimization

**Migration Decision Framework:**

- Don't migrate for savings < $50/month
- Do migrate when costs exceed $100/month for single service
- Time value calculation: (Hourly rate √ó Migration hours) vs (Monthly savings √ó Break-even months)
