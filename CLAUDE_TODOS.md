# Claude Code Todo List - Civilyst Development

_Last updated: January 2, 2025_

## � **REALISTIC PROJECT STATUS**

**Current State: MVP Functional but Technical Debt Needs Addressing**

The application is **functional** but has several **critical issues** that need immediate attention before it can be considered production-ready.

---

## 🔴 **CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately - P0)**

### 1. Build Configuration Bypasses ⚠️ **BLOCKING PRODUCTION**

**Files:** `next.config.ts`
**Status:** 🔴 Active Issue

```typescript
// CURRENT - DANGEROUS FOR PRODUCTION
typescript: {
  ignoreBuildErrors: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
},
eslint: {
  ignoreDuringBuilds: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
},
```

**Issues:**

- TypeScript errors are hidden during development
- Code quality issues not caught
- Could cause runtime errors in production

**Action Required:**

- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and fix all ESLint errors
- [ ] Run TypeScript check and fix all type errors
- [ ] Remove build bypasses for production builds
- [ ] Test full build pipeline

**Estimate:** 4-6 hours

### 2. Authentication Integration Incomplete 🔑 **MISSING CORE FEATURE**

**Files:** Multiple router files, components
**Status:** 🔴 Partially Implemented

**Current Issues:**

```typescript
// TODO: Get userId from Clerk when auth is connected
// TODO: Replace with actual user data
name: ('Demo User', // TODO: Replace with actual user data
  (currentUserId = 'mock_user_id')); // TODO: Replace with actual user ID
```

**Missing:**

- [ ] Proper Clerk auth integration in tRPC routers
- [ ] Real user data instead of mock/demo data
- [ ] User session handling in components
- [ ] Protected routes implementation

**Estimate:** 8-12 hours

### 3. Core Feature Placeholders 🚧 **INCOMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY**

**Status:** 🔴 Multiple TODOs

**Major Missing Features:**

```typescript
// TODO: Implement voice-to-campaign creation
// TODO: Implement AI photo-to-campaign generation
// TODO: Implement location-based campaign creation
// TODO: Implement AI-powered campaign suggestions
// TODO: Implement voice search for campaigns
// TODO: Implement campaign search
// TODO: Implement feedback system
// TODO: Implement load more functionality
```

**Action Required:**

- [ ] Prioritize which features are MVP vs nice-to-have
- [ ] Implement core search functionality
- [ ] Implement pagination/load more
- [ ] Remove or implement placeholder features

**Estimate:** 16-24 hours

---

## 🟡 **HIGH PRIORITY (P1)**

### 4. Error Boundaries & Loading States ✅ **ACTUALLY COMPLETE**

**Status:** ✅ **WELL IMPLEMENTED**

**What's Actually Done:**

- ✅ Comprehensive error boundary system with 5 different types
- ✅ Advanced error classification (TRPC, network, chunk loading)
- ✅ Loading states with AsyncBoundary and Suspense
- ✅ Skeleton UI for campaign pages
- ✅ Built-in loading states in UI components

**Conclusion:** This todo was inaccurate - error handling is excellent.

### 5. Service Integrations Missing 🔌 **DEGRADED FUNCTIONALITY**

**Status:** 🟡 Partially Configured

**Currently Disabled Services:**

- ❌ Upstash Redis (caching) - affects performance
- ❌ Uploadthing (file uploads) - no image uploads
- ❌ Mapbox (maps) - limited map functionality
- ❌ Resend (email) - no email notifications
- ❌ LaunchDarkly (feature flags) - no A/B testing

**Action Required:**

- [ ] Configure missing environment variables
- [ ] Test each service integration
- [ ] Add fallbacks for missing services
- [ ] Document which services are optional vs required

**Estimate:** 6-8 hours

---

## 🟠 **MEDIUM PRIORITY (P2)**

### 6. Type Safety Issues 🔧 **CODE QUALITY**

**Files:** `src/server/api/routers/campaigns.ts`, others
**Status:** 🟠 Type Casting Workarounds

**Issues:**

```typescript
// WORKAROUNDS THROUGHOUT CODEBASE
status: campaign.status as PrismaCampaignStatus,
createdAt: Date | string; // Should be just Date
// Manual date parsing everywhere
```

**Action Required:**

- [ ] Fix Prisma enum type handling
- [ ] Remove manual type casting
- [ ] Restore proper superjson transformer
- [ ] Remove manual date parsing

**Estimate:** 4-6 hours

### 7. Environment Variable Validation 🔧 **CONFIGURATION**

**File:** `src/env.ts`
**Status:** 🟠 Weakened Validation

**Issue:**

```typescript
// WEAKENED TO FIX BUILD
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL: z.string().optional(), // Was .url() validation
```

**Action Required:**

- [ ] Restore strict URL validation
- [ ] Handle empty strings properly
- [ ] Test with various environment configurations

**Estimate:** 1-2 hours

---

## 🔵 **LOW PRIORITY (P3)**

### 8. Database Performance Optimization 📊 **PERFORMANCE**

**Status:** 🔵 Functional but Unoptimized

**Current State:**

- Basic queries work
- No advanced indexing
- No query optimization
- No performance monitoring

**Action Required:**

- [ ] Add database indexes for common queries
- [ ] Optimize N+1 query patterns
- [ ] Add query performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement proper pagination

**Estimate:** 6-8 hours

### 9. Real-time Features Enhancement 🔄 **NICE TO HAVE**

**Status:** 🔵 Basic Implementation

**Current:**

- Basic Supabase subscriptions
- Limited real-time updates

**Improvements:**

- [ ] Real-time campaign updates
- [ ] Live voting updates
- [ ] Push notifications for activities
- [ ] Connection status indicators

**Estimate:** 8-12 hours

---

## 📊 **ACCURATE COMPLETION STATUS**

### **Critical Path Items:**

- 🔴 **25% Complete** - Core issues block production
- Authentication: 30% implemented
- Build quality: Compromised
- Feature completeness: 60% implemented

### **Overall Assessment:**

- **Infrastructure:** 70% complete
- **Core Features:** 60% complete
- **Code Quality:** 40% (due to bypasses)
- **Production Readiness:** 30%

---

## 🎯 **REALISTIC ROADMAP**

### **Week 1: Make Production-Ready**

1. Fix build configuration bypasses
2. Complete authentication integration
3. Remove mock/demo data
4. Test deployment pipeline

### **Week 2: Complete Core Features**

1. Implement search functionality
2. Add pagination/load more
3. Fix type safety issues
4. Configure missing services

### **Week 3: Polish & Performance**

1. Database optimization
2. Enhanced real-time features
3. Comprehensive testing
4. Performance monitoring

### **Week 4: Launch Preparation**

1. Security audit
2. Documentation completion
3. Monitoring setup
4. Go-live checklist

---

## 🚨 **HONEST ASSESSMENT**

**The previous "100% COMPLETE" claim was completely inaccurate.**

**Reality Check:**

- ✅ **Strong foundation** with good architecture
- ✅ **Excellent error handling** system already implemented
- ✅ **Modern tech stack** properly configured
- ⚠️ **Critical gaps** in auth and core features
- ⚠️ **Build quality** compromised by bypasses
- ⚠️ **Mock data** throughout the application

**Bottom Line:** This is a solid MVP foundation that needs focused work to be production-ready, not a complete application.

## 🎯 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Ready for Production When:**

- [ ] All builds pass without bypasses
- [ ] Real user authentication works end-to-end
- [ ] Core search and filtering implemented
- [ ] No mock/demo data in production
- [ ] Service integrations tested and working
- [ ] Performance meets benchmarks

**Realistic Timeline:** 3-4 weeks of focused development
